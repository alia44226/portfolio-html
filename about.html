<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>This webpage Is not for you to be interested in hiring me this is just to tell you about 
  me I only know HTML at the momment and I'm interested in making websites that's why I'm learning 
  CSS, JavaScript, node.js. I started coding last month (November 2024). I don't want to be
  hired because at the momment I'm learning but in the future when I'm good at coding
  that's when I'd want to be hired.
